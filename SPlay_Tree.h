/**
 * The following function is a Splay tree implementation.
 * Following functions and their O (meshuharah):
 *
 * 1) Constructors - O(1);
 * 2) Copy Constructor - O(n), n being the elements in the tree
 * 3) Delete Constructor - O(n), n being the elements in the tree.
 * 4) Get(T&  key) - O(logn), Finding an element in BST, and splaying
 * 5) getMin() - O(logn), finding the minimal element in the BST
 * 6) getMax() - O(logn), finding the maximum element in the BST
 * to the root
 * 7) isempty() - O(1), checks if there's atleast one element in the tree
 * 8) Insert(T& value) - inserts a copy of that value into the tree. O(Logn)
 * because gotta find the location it belong to and splay it up.
 * 9) Delete(T& key) - deletes an element from the tree (if it doesnt exist)
 * then splays the closest value to the top of the tree.
 * 10) Count() - O(n) goes in inorder and counts all the elements in the tree
 * 11) inOrderRL(int *numOfT, T*& data) - O(n), copies the tree information
 * into an array for future use and gives out the number of elements.
 * 12) SortedArrayToTree(T*& array, int start, int end) - O(n), given an array of
 * T and a tree of T, creates a BST tree out of it using the binary search
 * Algorimth.
